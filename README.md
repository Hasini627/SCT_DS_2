# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous **Titanic dataset** to uncover survival patterns based on factors like age, gender, and passenger class.  
It uses **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** to clean the data and generate visual insights.

📊 Visualizations

The analysis includes:
Survival Count – overall survivors vs non-survivors
Survival by Gender – female passengers had higher survival rates
Survival by Passenger Class – higher classes had better survival chances
Age Distribution – younger passengers had slightly better odds
Correlation Heatmap – correlation between numeric features

🔍 Insights

Women had a much higher survival rate than men.
1st-class passengers were more likely to survive compared to 3rd-class.
Younger passengers (children) had a higher chance of survival.

🚀 Future Work

Apply Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to predict survival.
Build an interactive dashboard for Titanic analysis.
